SUMMARY OF UNADJUSTED MISSTATEMENTS (SUD)
Client: {{client_name}}
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This schedule summarises all factual, judgmental, and projected misstatements identified 
during the audit that remain unadjusted at the completion stage. The purpose is to assess 
their aggregate effect on the financial statements and determine whether the financial 
statements are materially misstated.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. MATERIALITY BENCHMARKS]

Overall Materiality (OM): {{overall_materiality}}  
Performance Materiality (PM): {{performance_materiality}}

Evaluation threshold: Unadjusted misstatements are evaluated both individually and in the 
aggregate as required by ISA 450.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. MACHINE-READABLE DATA SCHEMA]

# Use this schema in RAG for structured storage and automated generation

SUD_SCHEMA:
  misstatement_id: "<string>"
  area: "<e.g., Revenue, Inventory, PPE>"
  type: "Factual | Judgmental | Projected"
  description: "<short text>"
  amount: "<numeric value>"
  proposed_adjustment: "<journal entry or null>"
  management_decision: "Adjusted | Not adjusted"
  rationale: "<explanation from management>"
  auditor_comment: "<optional>"
  impact_on_FS:
    asset: "<+/- amount>"
    liability: "<+/- amount>"
    equity: "<+/- amount>"
    profit_before_tax: "<+/- amount>"
  severity: "Low | Moderate | High"
  linked_risk_id: "<SRxx or null>"
  linked_testing: "<reference to test work>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. DETAILED TABLE OF UNADJUSTED MISSTATEMENTS]

Below is the list of all uncorrected misstatements:

{{misstatements_table}}

# Recommended human-readable table:

# | Ref | Area | Type | Description | Amount | Impact (PBT/Assets) | Severity | Management Decision | Auditor Comment |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. AGGREGATION OF MISSTATEMENTS]

TOTAL_UNADJUSTED: {{total_unadjusted}}

# Machine logic:

AGGREGATION_LOGIC:
  total_unadjusted = SUM(amount WHERE management_decision = "Not adjusted")
  threshold_PM = performance_materiality
  threshold_80pct_PM = 0.8 * performance_materiality

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. EVALUATION AGAINST MATERIALITY (ISA 450)]

Evaluation summary:

{{evaluation_vs_materiality}}

# Machine-readable evaluation:

EVALUATION_LOGIC:
  IF total_unadjusted > threshold_PM:
      result = "Material misstatement — financial statements NOT acceptable."
      impact = "Adverse or Qualified opinion likely."
  ELSE IF total_unadjusted > threshold_80pct_PM:
      result = "Close to PM — partner judgement required; enhanced disclosures recommended."
  ELSE:
      result = "Below PM — financial statements acceptable from quantitative perspective."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO CONSIDER]

# Required by ISA 450 even if amounts are small:

QUALITATIVE_FLAGS:
  - "Does the misstatement relate to a sensitive disclosure?"
  - "Does it mask a trend?"
  - "Does it turn a loss into a profit or vice versa?"
  - "Is it the result of bias in estimates?"
  - "Does it indicate potential fraud?"
  - "Has management refused multiple proposed adjustments?"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. PARTNER CONCLUSION]

Partner conclusion on the acceptability of uncorrected misstatements:

{{partner_conclusion}}

# Example (to be generated automatically):
#   "Based on the aggregate value of uncorrected misstatements and consideration of 
#    qualitative factors, we conclude that the financial statements are not materially misstated 
#    and an unmodified audit opinion is appropriate."

Appendices may include:
- Working papers showing calculation of projected misstatements
- Management representation supporting judgmental amounts
- Materiality computation sheets
- Extracts of JE testing
