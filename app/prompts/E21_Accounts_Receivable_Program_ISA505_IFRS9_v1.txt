ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AUDIT PROGRAM — ISA 505 + IFRS 9  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This program covers existence, valuation, confirmation procedures, subsequent receipts,
ECL impairment under IFRS 9, and fraud risks per ISA 240.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE POPULATION]

{{ar_population}}

Required breakdown:
- Trade receivables  
- Related party receivables  
- Notes receivable  
- Retention receivables  
- Contract assets (IFRS 15)  
- Long-outstanding balances (aged > 180 days)  
- Specifically provided items  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT — ISA 315 + ISA 240]

{{risk_assessment}}

Key AR risks:
- Existence risk (most significant)  
- Overstatement due to fictitious sales (ISA 240 fraud risk)  
- Incorrect cut-off from revenue (link to E18)  
- Incorrect valuation (IFRS 9 ECL model issues)  
- Related party exposures undisclosed  
- Disputed balances  
- Manipulation through manual JEs (link to E11)

Mandatory presumed fraud risk:
- Revenue recognition → directly feeds into AR existence.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. MACHINE-READABLE AR SCHEMA]

AR_ITEM_SCHEMA:
  id: "<ARxx>"
  customer: "<string>"
  invoice_no: "<string>"
  invoice_date: "<date>"
  due_date: "<date>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  aged_bucket: "<0-30|31-60|61-90|91-180|180+>"
  subsequent_receipt: "<numeric or null>"
  confirmed_balance: "<numeric or null>"
  dispute_status: "<none|partial|full>"
  credit_risk_grade: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  ecl_amount: "<numeric>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. CONFIRMATIONS PLAN — ISA 505]

{{confirmations_plan}}

ISA 505 requirements:
- Auditor controls the confirmation process  
- Positive confirmations required for AR (negative only in rare low-risk scenarios)  
- Ensure sample includes:
  * large balances  
  * old balances  
  * related party balances  
  * disputed items  
  * zero-balance accounts (fraud indicator)

Schema:

CONFIRMATION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<CONFxx>"
  customer: "<string>"
  balance_per_client: "<numeric>"
  balance_confirmed: "<numeric>"
  difference: "<numeric>"
  customer_comment: "<text>"
  confirmation_received: "<true|false>"
  alternative_procedures_required: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

Fraud red flags:
- customer unreachable  
- responses routed through management  
- customer refuses to confirm  
- discrepancies with delivery records  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. SUBSEQUENT RECEIPTS TESTING (PRIMARY ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE)]

{{subsequent_receipts}}

Steps:
- Review cash receipts after year-end (link to E20 Cash & Bank)  
- Match receipts to outstanding invoices  
- For partial receipts → allocate correctly  
- For no receipts → evaluate credit risk  

Schema:

SUBSEQUENT_RECEIPT_SCHEMA:
  id: "<SRxx>"
  ar_id: "<ARxx>"
  receipt_date: "<date>"
  amount_received: "<numeric>"
  traced_to_bank: "<true|false>"
  full_settlement: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. AGING ANALYSIS (KEY TO IFRS 9 IMPAIRMENT)]

{{aging_analysis}}

Requirements:
- Obtain aging report  
- Reconcile total to GL  
- Identify past-due exposures  
- Analyse long-outstanding balances  
- Evaluate disputes  
- Tie to ECL staging:
  * Stage 1 → performing  
  * Stage 2 → Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)  
  * Stage 3 → credit-impaired  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. DISPUTED AND UNUSUAL BALANCES REVIEW]

{{disputes_review}}

Analyze:
- Legal claims  
- Customer complaints  
- Volume rebates and contractual adjustments  
- Sales returns  
- Performance obligation issues (IFRS 15 linkage)  

Red flags:
- balances repeatedly disputed  
- mismatched quantities between AR and delivery logs  
- unusual debit balances on customer accounts  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT (IFRS 9 REQUIREMENT)]

{{credit_risk}}

Procedures:
- Evaluate internal credit grading  
- Review credit limits and overrides  
- Review customer financial difficulties  
- Analyse concentration risk  
- Check for related party / shell-company structures  

Schema:

CREDIT_RISK_SCHEMA:
  id: "<CRxx>"
  customer: "<string>"
  grade: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  indicators:
    - "<past_due_days>"
    - "<financial_difficulties>"
    - "<SICR>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. ECL TESTING (IFRS 9 EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES)]

{{ecl_testing}}

Test:
1. **Model logic**  
   - PD (Probability of Default)  
   - LGD (Loss Given Default)  
   - EAD (Exposure at Default)  

2. **Assumptions**  
   - forward-looking information  
   - macroeconomic overlays  
   - SICR triggers  

3. **Data quality**  
   - aging data  
   - historical loss data  
   - customer segmentation  

Schema:

ECL_SCHEMA:
  id: "<ECLxx>"
  customer: "<string>"
  exposure: "<numeric>"
  pd: "<numeric>"
  lgd: "<numeric>"
  ead: "<numeric>"
  ecl_amount: "<numeric>"
  methodology_reviewed: "<true|false>"
  assumptions_tested: "<true|false>"
  data_quality: "<High|Medium|Low>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[10. JOURNAL ENTRY TESTING LINKAGE (ISA 240)]

{{je_testing_link}}

Critical JE focus:
- manual credits to AR  
- write-offs  
- reversals after year-end  
- contra-revenue adjustments  
- creation of fictitious sales

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. AR valuation supported via ECL analysis  
3. Misstatements identified but not material
