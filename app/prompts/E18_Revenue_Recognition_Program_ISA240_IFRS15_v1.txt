REVENUE RECOGNITION AUDIT PROGRAM — ISA 240 + IFRS 15  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This program documents the audit of revenue recognition, the presumed fraud risk per ISA 240, 
and the application of the IFRS 15 revenue model.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. REVENUE STREAMS & NATURE OF BUSINESS]

{{revenue_streams}}

Examples:
- Sale of goods (point-in-time)
- Service revenue (over time)
- Subscription revenue
- Long-term construction contracts
- Licensing and royalty arrangements
- Telecom/service bundles

Each stream must be mapped to the IFRS 15 5-step model.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT — ISA 240 (PRESUMED FRAUD RISK)]

ISA 240 requires:
- Mandatory identification of revenue recognition as a fraud risk  
- Mandatory testing of journal entries  
- Mandatory assessment of unusual or complex transactions  
- Heightened professional scepticism

{{risk_assessment}}

RISK FACTORS:
- Incentives to inflate revenue  
- Manual override opportunities  
- High-volume transactions  
- Significant judgement in determining timing of revenue  
- Significant cut-off sensitivity  
- Complex contract terms  
- Multiple-element arrangements (bundles)  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. IFRS 15 — 5-STEP MODEL (MANDATORY TESTING)]

{{ifrs15_mapping}}

For each revenue stream, auditor must test:

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT  
- Existence of enforceable rights and obligations  
- Contract approval  
- Collectability assessment  
- Contract combination rules  

STEP 2 — IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  
- Distinct goods or services  
- Bundled arrangements  
- Series of services  

STEP 3 — DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE  
- Fixed/variable consideration  
- Price concessions  
- Rebates, bonuses, penalties  
- Significant financing components  

STEP 4 — ALLOCATE PRICE TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  
- Stand-alone selling price (SSP)  
- Allocation methods  

STEP 5 — RECOGNISE REVENUE  
- Point-in-time recognition: risk transfer indicators  
- Over-time recognition: progress measures (cost-to-cost, output method)  
- Cut-off testing  
- Proof of delivery / service evidence  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  exceptions: "<text>"
  conclusion: "<supported|not_supported>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. CUT-OFF TESTING (MANDATORY: HIGHEST RISK AREA)]

{{cutoff_testing}}

Procedures:
- Select samples 5–10 days pre- and post-period end  
- Inspect delivery notes, shipping documents, service logs  
- Match to invoices and GL posting date  
- Evaluate FOB/Incoterm impact (for goods)  
- Evaluate completion evidence (for services)

  delivery_date: "<date>"
  revenue_recognised_date: "<date>"
  correct_period: "<true|false>"
  difference_amount: "<numeric>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. CONTRACT-LEVEL TESTING (IFRS 15 STEP 1–5)]

{{contract_testing}}

Procedures include:
- Inspect contract and amendments  
- Identify POs  
- Recalculate allocation to POs  
- Evaluate variable consideration constraint  
- Recalculate revenue recognised YTD  
- For over-time PO:
  * recalculate progress (input/output)  
  * inspect cost backup, milestones, certifications  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. JOURNAL ENTRY TESTING (LINK TO E11 — MANUAL OVERRIDE)]

{{je_testing_link}}

Mandatory:
- Focus on revenue, accrued revenue, contract assets, unearned revenue  
- Identify unusual credits to revenue  
- Identify JE posted near period-end  
- Identify JE posted by senior management or admin users  

Include reference: `<E11_JETE_Journal_Entries>`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES (ISA 520)]

{{analytical_procedures}}

Procedures:
- Trend analysis by product/customer  
- Gross margin analysis (identify anomalies)  
- Volume × price analysis  
- Ratio analysis:
  * DSO  
  * revenue per unit  
  * revenue per subscriber (if SaaS/telecom)  
  * AR ageing vs revenue patterns  

Analytical red flags:
- Revenue growth inconsistent with operational data  
- Margins significantly deviating from historical trends  
- Revenue spikes at period-end  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[10. EXCEPTIONS SUMMARY]

{{exceptions_summary}}

Exception schema:

EXCEPTION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<string>"
  rev_id: "<REVxx>"
  description: "<text>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  type: "<cutoff_error|incorrect_PO_id|incorrect_allocation|unsupported_variable_consideration|manual_override_indicator>"
  severity: "<Low|Medium|High>"

  impact_on_FS: "<text>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[11. OVERALL CONCLUSION (ISA 240 + IFRS 15 COMPLIANCE)]

{{conclusion}}

Conclusion categories:
1. **Revenue appropriately recognised under IFRS 15**  
2. **Errors identified but not material** (→ SUD link)  
3. **Material misstatement exists** → potential opinion modification  
4. **Evidence insufficient** → scope limitation → possible Disclaimer  

Fraud-specific conclusion (ISA 240):
- evidence of override?  
- evidence of fictitious revenue?  
- aggressive cut-off?  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[12. APPENDICES]

{{appendices}}

Possible appendices:
- Contract extracts  
- PO mapping worksheets  
- Allocation models  
- Cut-off sample sheets  
- Variable consideration calculations  
- Analytical procedures outputs
