PAYROLL & HR AUDIT PROGRAM — ISA 330  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

Payroll is one of the highest OPEX categories.  
Major risks: existence of employees, accuracy of payments, fraud through ghost employees.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. PAYROLL POPULATION]

{{payroll_population}}

Include:
- Full-time employees  
- Part-time employees  
- Contractors (if payroll-processed)  
- Bonus & incentive programs  
- Overtime  
- Allowances (transportation, meals, housing, hardship)  
- Terminated staff in period  
- New hires

[2. RISK ASSESSMENT — ISA 315 + ISA 240]

{{risk_assessment}}

Typical payroll risks:
- **Ghost employees** (fraud — ISA 240)  
- Incorrect salary rates  
- Unauthorized changes to HR master data  
- Incorrect accrual of bonuses/leave  
- Incorrect payroll taxes and contributions  
- Duplicate or manual payments  
- Backdated terminations  

Fraud red flags:
- Payroll manager with system admin rights  
- Payments to unknown bank accounts  
- Salary increases without approval  
- Split payments (salary divided across accounts)  
- Employees without contracts
