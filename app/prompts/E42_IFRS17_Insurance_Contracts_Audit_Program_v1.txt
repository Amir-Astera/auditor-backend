INSURANCE CONTRACTS — IFRS 17  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Reporting period ended: {{period_end}}

This program is designed for life, non-life, health, reinsurance, and composite insurers
applying IFRS 17. It must be used together with:
- E30 Disclosure Checklist
- E37 Financial Instruments Disclosures (IFRS 7)
- E32 Cash Flow Statement (IAS 7)
- E34 Equity & Capital
- E35/E36 Group Audit modules

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[0. IFRS 17 SCOPE AND INTERACTIONS]

{{ifrs17_scope}}

Scope checks:
- Identify all insurance contracts issued (life, non-life, health, credit, etc.)
- Identify investment contracts with discretionary participation features (DPF)
- Identify distinct investment components / distinct service components (IFRS 17 vs IFRS 15 / IFRS 9)
- Identify reinsurance contracts held
- Identify financial instruments that remain under IFRS 9 (e.g. certain investment contracts without DPF)

Schema:

IFRS17_SCOPE_SCHEMA:
  id: "<SCOPExx>"
  product_name: "<string>"
  is_insurance_contract: "<true|false>"
  is_investment_contract_with_DPF: "<true|false>"
  falls_under_IFRS9: "<true|false>"
  reinsurance_held: "<true|false>"
  comments: "<text>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. PORTFOLIOS, GROUPS AND UNIT OF ACCOUNT]

{{portfolio_structure}}

Key concepts:
- Portfolio = contracts subject to similar risks and managed together
- Within each portfolio, contracts grouped at initial recognition into:
  * onerous contracts
  * contracts with no significant possibility of becoming onerous
  * remaining contracts

Schema:

IFRS17_PORTFOLIO_SCHEMA:
  id: "<PORTxx>"
  portfolio_name: "<string>"
  line_of_business: "<life|non_life|health|reinsurance|other>"
  managed_together: "<true|false>"
  risk_characteristics: "<text>"

  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT — IFRS 17 + ISA 540 (HIGH ESTIMATION RISK)]

{{risk_assessment}}

Key risks:
- Incorrect product scoping (IFRS 17 vs IFRS 9 / IFRS 15)
- Incorrect grouping (portfolios, annual cohorts, onerous grouping)
- Model risk in actuarial valuation (FCF, RA, CSM)
- Data quality & completeness from policy admin systems
- Incorrect discount rates / yield curves
- Incorrect risk adjustment for non-financial risk
- Incorrect CSM rollforward and release pattern
- Incorrect LRC / LIC split and movements
- Errors in reinsurance held (mismatch with underlying)
- Incorrect presentation of insurance revenue, insurance service result, insurance finance income/expenses
- Missing or incomplete disclosures

Fraud risks:
- Management bias in assumptions (mortality, lapse, expenses, discount rate)
- Understating onerous contracts and loss components
- Manipulating CSM release to smooth profit

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. PRODUCT MAPPING AND CONTRACT BOUNDARY]

{{product_mapping}}

Steps:
- Map each product to an IFRS 17 portfolio
- Determine if any components are separated (distinct investment component; distinct service component)
- Determine contract boundary:
  * when entity has practical ability to reprice
  * when entity has a substantive obligation to provide coverage

- **VFA (Variable Fee Approach)**:
  For direct participating contracts where entity’s fee is variable based on underlying items
