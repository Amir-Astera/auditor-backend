- ISA 580 (Written Representations)
- ISA 240 / ISA 330 (fraud, risk responses)
- IFRS: IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), IAS 10 (Events after the Reporting Period)

─────────────────────────────────────────────
Identification Channels
-----------------------
- Management inquiry and in-house legal department
- External counsel letter (lawyer’s letter)
- Board of Directors and Audit Committee minutes
- General ledger scan of legal/professional fees
- Correspondence with regulators, tax authorities, plaintiffs
- Complaints register
- Public domain: press releases, regulator websites

─────────────────────────────────────────────
Decision Rules (IAS 37 / IAS 10)
--------------------------------
- Probable → Provision (recognise liability in FS)
- Possible → Contingent liability disclosure only
- Remote → No disclosure required
- Adjusting event (IAS 10): condition existed at reporting date → adjust FS
- Non-adjusting event: condition arose after reporting date → disclose only
- Refusal to provide lawyer’s letter or mgmt limitation → consider scope limitation (ISA 705)
