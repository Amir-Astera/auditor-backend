INVESTMENT PROPERTY — IAS 40 • IFRS 13  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This audit program evaluates classification, fair value measurement,
valuation assumptions, rental income, operating expenses, transfers,
and disclosures under IAS 40.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. INVESTMENT PROPERTY CLASSES]

{{ip_classes}}

Examples:
- Office buildings  
- Warehouses  
- Logistics centers  
- Retail stores  
- Hotels (if held to earn rentals, not operate)  
- Mixed-use property  
- Land held for appreciation  

Schema:

IP_CLASS_SCHEMA:
  id: "<IPCLxx>"
  asset_name: "<string>"
  type: "<building|land|mixed-use|hotel|warehouse>"
  measurement_model: "<fair_value|cost>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT — IAS 40]

{{risk_assessment}}

Key risks:
- Incorrect classification  
- Manipulation of fair value  
- Unsupported assumptions in valuation  
- Missing transfers between models  
- Omitted impairment indicators (if cost model)  
- Incorrect rental income recognition  
- Missing disclosures  

Fraud risks:
- Inflating fair value to improve financial ratios  
- Understating operating expenses  
- Misclassifying owner-occupied property as IP  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. CLASSIFICATION TESTING — IAS 40 vs IAS 16 vs IFRS 5]

{{classification_testing}}

Rules:
- IP = property held to **earn rentals** or **for capital appreciation**  
- Owner-occupied property → IAS 16  
- Property under development → depends on intention  
- Held for sale → IFRS 5  

Schema:

CLASSIFICATION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<CLSxx>"
  asset_name: "<string>"
  classification: "<IAS40|IAS16|IFRS5>"
  basis: "<text>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. VALUATION TESTING (FAIR VALUE MODEL) — IFRS 13]

{{valuation_testing}}

Tests:
- Determine valuation technique:
  * Market approach  
  * Income approach (DCF, capitalization)  
  * Cost approach (rare)  
- Evaluate significant inputs:
  * market rents  
  * discount rates  
  * capitalization rates  
  * vacancy rates  
  * maintenance costs  
  * growth assumptions  
- Evaluate independence of valuer  
- Recalculate sensitivity  

Schema:

FAIR_VALUE_SCHEMA:
  id: "<FVxx>"
  property_name: "<string>"
  valuation_technique: "<market|income|cost>"
  fair_value: "<numeric>"
  key_inputs: "<text>"
  discount_rate: "<numeric>"
  cap_rate: "<numeric>"
  rental_value: "<numeric>"
  sensitivity: "<numeric>"
  level: "<2|3>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. RENTAL INCOME TESTING (IFRS 16 + IFRS 15 LINKS)**]

{{rental_income_testing}}

Tests:
- Inspect lease agreements  
- Verify rent rolls  
- Test variable lease payments  
- Reconcile rental income to lease schedules  
- Test straight-line adjustments  
- Test incentives  

Schema:

RENTAL_SCHEMA:
  id: "<RENTxx>"
  tenant: "<string>"
  contract_terms: "<text>"
  rent_billed: "<numeric>"
  rent_received: "<numeric>"
  straight_line_adjustment: "<numeric>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. OPERATING EXPENSES TESTING (SERVICE CHARGE, MAINTENANCE)]  

{{operating_expenses}}

Tests:
- Verify service charge recoveries  
- Test maintenance & repairs  
- Review property management fees  
- Test completeness of utility cost allocations  

Schema:

OPERATING_EXPENSE_SCHEMA:
  id: "<OPEXX>"
  expense_type: "<service_charge|utilities|maintenance|management_fee>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  allocation_basis: "<text>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. TRANSFERS IN / OUT OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY (IAS 40.57–64)**]

{{transfers}}

Transfers **into** IP are allowed only if:
- change in use is evidenced  

Allowed evidence:
- commencement of an operating lease to another party  
- end of owner-occupation  

Transfers **out** of IP:
- owner-occupation begins  
- development begins for sale  

Schema:

TRANSFER_SCHEMA:
  id: "<TRANxx>"
  asset_name: "<string>"
  from_category: "<IAS40|IAS16|IAS2|IFRS5>"
  to_category: "<IAS40|IAS16|IAS2|IFRS5>"
  evidence_of_change_in_use: "<text>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. IMPAIRMENT TESTING (COST MODEL ONLY)**]

{{impairment_testing}}

Tests:
- Identify impairment indicators under IAS 36  
- Test recoverable amount:  
  * value in use  
  * fair value less cost to sell  
- Compare carrying amount to recoverable amount  

Schema:

IMPAIRMENT_SCHEMA:
  id: "<IMPxx>"
  asset_name: "<string>"
  carrying_amount: "<numeric>"
  recoverable_amount: "<numeric>"
  impairment_required: "<true|false>"
  impairment_amount: "<numeric>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. DISCLOSURES — IAS 40 + IFRS 13]
