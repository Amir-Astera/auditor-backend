LEASES — IFRS 16  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This program covers identification, recognition, measurement, impairment,
discount rate derivation, exemption application, and modifications.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. LEASE POPULATION]

{{lease_population}}

Include:
- Property leases (offices, warehouses, retail spaces)  
- Equipment leases (machinery, servers, vehicles)  
- IT equipment leases  
- Embedded leases in service agreements  
- Short-term leases  
- Low-value leases  
- Variable consideration leases  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT — IFRS 16 + ISA 540]

{{risk_assessment}}

Key risks:
- Missing leases (most common critical risk)  
- Incorrect classification of service contracts  
- Incorrect discount rates (IBR too low)  
- Incorrect lease term (optional periods handling)  
- Incorrect ROU asset / liability measurement  
- Ignoring lease modifications  
- Impairment of ROU assets (linked to IAS 36)  
- Incorrect variable payment accounting  

Fraud risks:
- Understating lease liabilities to improve leverage ratios  
- Aggressive use of exemptions  
- Manipulated discount rates  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. MACHINE-READABLE LEASE SCHEMA]

LEASE_SCHEMA:
  id: "<Lxx>"
  asset_description: "<text>"
  contract_id: "<string>"
  lease_term_years: "<numeric>"
  non_cancellable_period: "<numeric>"
  extension_options: "<included|excluded>"
  termination_options: "<included|excluded>"
  fixed_payments: "<numeric>"
  variable_payments: "<numeric>"
  discount_rate: "<numeric>"
  lease_liability_initial: "<numeric>"
  rou_asset_initial: "<numeric>"
  modification_flag: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. CONTRACT IDENTIFICATION (LEASE vs NON-LEASE)**]

{{contract_identification}}

Test if the contract conveys:
1. Right to control  
2. Identified asset  
3. Economic benefits  

Embedded lease analysis needed for:
- IT outsourcing  
- Equipment with operator  
- Transportation contracts  

Schema:

LEASE_ID_SCHEMA:
  id: "<LIDxx>"
  contract_id: "<string>"
  identified_asset: "<true|false>"
  control_present: "<true|false>"
  substation_right: "<true|false>"
  lease_exists: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. INITIAL MEASUREMENT TESTING**

{{initial_measurement}}

Verify:
- Lease liability = PV of lease payments  
- ROU asset =  
  lease liability  
  + initial direct costs  
  + restoration obligations (E27)  
  - incentives received  

Schema:

INITIAL_MEASURE_SCHEMA:
  id: "<IMxx>"
  lease_id: "<Lxx>"
  lease_liability_calc: "<numeric>"
  rou_calc: "<numeric>"
  auditor_lease_liability: "<numeric>"
  auditor_rou: "<numeric>"
  variance: "<numeric>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT TESTING]

{{subsequent_measurement}}

Test:
- Interest accretion  
- Lease payment allocation  
- ROU depreciation  
- Variable lease payments  
- Impairment triggers for ROU assets  

Schema:

SUBSEQUENT_SCHEMA:
  id: "<SUBxx>"
  lease_id: "<Lxx>"
  interest_expense: "<numeric>"
  depreciation_expense: "<numeric>"
  liability_closing_balance: "<numeric>"
  rou_closing_balance: "<numeric>"
  impairment_required: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. DISCOUNT RATE TESTING (IBR)**]

{{discount_rate_testing}}

Steps:
- Start with risk-free rate  
- Add credit spread  
- Add asset-specific risk premium  
- Adjust for lease term  
- Compare to external benchmarking data  

Schema:

DISCOUNT_RATE_SCHEMA:
  id: "<DRxx>"
  lease_id: "<Lxx>"
  risk_free_rate: "<numeric>"
  credit_spread: "<numeric>"
  adjustments: "<numeric>"
  final_ibr: "<numeric>"
  auditor_rate: "<numeric>"
  variance: "<numeric>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. MODIFICATION TESTING**

{{modifications}}

Modification triggers:
- Changes in lease term  
- Renegotiations in payment terms  
- Changes from termination/extension decisions  
- Add/remove underlying assets  

Auditor must test:
- Remeasurement of liability  
- Corresponding adjustment to ROU asset  

Schema:

MODIFICATION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<MODxx>"
  lease_id: "<Lxx>"
  modification_event: "<text>"
  liability_after_mod: "<numeric>"
  rou_after_mod: "<numeric>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. SALE-AND-LEASEBACK TESTING**

{{sale_and_leaseback}}

Test:
- Whether a sale occurred per IFRS 15  
- Correct recognition of gain/loss  
- Correct measurement of ROU asset proportion  
- Transaction structuring risk  

Schema:

SLB_SCHEMA:
  id: "<SLBxx>"
  asset_description: "<text>"
  sale_price: "<numeric>"
  carrying_amount: "<numeric>"
  gain_loss_recognized: "<numeric>"
  proportion_of_use_transferred: "<numeric>"
  compliant_with_IFRS15: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[10. EXCEPTIONS SUMMARY]

{{exceptions_summary}}

EXCEPTION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<string>"
  lease_id: "<Lxx>"
  area: "<identification|initial_measurement|subsequent|discount_rate|modification|SLB>"
  description: "<text>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  severity: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  linked_misstatement: "<MISID or null>"
  impact_on_FS: "<text>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[11. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MODULES]

Cross-link with:
- E19 PPE (impairment for ROU assets)  
- E27 Provisions (restoration obligations → increase ROU)  
- E26 Tax (temporary differences ROU vs liability)  
- E12 Subsequent Events  
- E11 JE Testing (lease-related reclass entries)  
- E20 Cash (lease payments verification)  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[12. OVERALL CONCLUSION]

{{conclusion}}

Conclusion categories:
1. Leases complete and identified correctly  
2. Initial and subsequent measurement correct  
3. Discount rates reasonable  
4. Modifications accounted correctly  
5. Exceptions immaterial  
6. Material misstatement exists  
7. Insufficient evidence → scope limitation  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[13. APPENDICES]

{{appendices}}

Typical:
- Lease contracts  
- IBR calculations  
- ROU asset schedules  
- Lease liability amortization schedules  
- Modification documents  
- Sale-and-leaseback agreements
