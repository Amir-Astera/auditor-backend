Subject: Management Letter — Internal Control Deficiencies Identified During the Audit
Entity: {{client_name}}
Period Ended: {{period_end}}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[INTRODUCTION]
We have completed our audit of the financial statements of {{client_name}} for the year ended 
{{period_end}} in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). As part of this audit, 
we obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the preparation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.

In accordance with ISA 265, we are required to communicate significant deficiencies in internal 
control identified during the audit to management and those charged with governance (TCWG).

[IMPORTANT LIMITATION]
Our procedures were not designed to identify all internal control deficiencies; therefore, the 
deficiencies described below may not represent all deficiencies that exist.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[SUMMARY_OF_DEFICIENCIES]
Below is a high-level summary of deficiencies identified:

[DETAILED_DEFICIENCIES]
The table below provides detailed findings, their classification, severity rating, potential impact, 
and our recommendations, along with space for management responses.

[DEFINITION OF SEVERITY LEVELS]
SIGNIFICANT:
  - Control failure with high likelihood of material misstatement.
  - Pervasive or systemic issue.
  - Required reporting to TCWG under ISA 265.

MODERATE:
  - Important control weakness, but unlikely to result in material misstatement.
  - Requires timely remediation by management.

LOW:
  - Minor deficiency that does not pose a significant risk.
  - Recommendation for improvement rather than required remediation.
