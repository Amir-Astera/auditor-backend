JOURNAL ENTRIES TESTING (JET)
Client: {{client_name}}
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This document outlines the required audit procedures related to management override of controls 
as required by ISA 240. These procedures apply to all audits, regardless of assessed risk.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. OVERVIEW (ISA 240 REQUIREMENTS)]

Mandatory components under ISA 240:
- Identify and test journal entries and other adjustments made in the financial reporting process.
- Select journal entries based on risk factors (manual, unusual, end-of-period, user override).
- Review accounting estimates for possible management bias.
- Review unusual or significant transactions outside the normal course of business.

This template focuses on the Journal Entries Testing component.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY]

Summary of risk related to management override:
{{risk_assessment_summary}}

# Example elements to include:
# - Fraud risk inherent level: High (ISA 240 mandatory)
# - Areas most susceptible: Revenue, Provisions, ECL, PPE revaluation, Inventory write-downs
# - System landscape (SAP / 1C / Oracle / In-house ERP)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. JETE STRATEGY & SCOPE]

JETE_STRATEGY:
{{jete_strategy}}

Topics to cover:
- Whether the entity uses manual or automated journals
- Who can post journals (roles, segregation)
- Whether "super-user" access exists
- Use of templates or recurring entries
- Controls over journal approvals
- Whether system logs and audit trails exist

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. JOURNAL POPULATION SUMMARY]

Summary of journals extracted:
{{journal_population_summary}}

# Machine schema:
JE_POPULATION_SCHEMA:
  total_entries: "<int>"
  period: "<date range>"
  system: "<ERP name>"
  posting_levels: ["HQ", "Branches", "Consolidation"]
  fields_extracted: ["JE number", "date", "posting date", "amount", "prepared_by", "approved_by", "description", "account", "cost center"]
  completeness_checks:
    - "<log review>"
    - "<record count reconciliation>"
    - "<control totals>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. SELECTION CRITERIA (ISA 240 MANDATORY LOGIC)]

SELECTION_CRITERIA:
{{selection_criteria}}

# Recommended criteria set (Big4 standard):

SELECTION_SCHEMA:
  high_risk_criteria:
    - "Manual journal entries posted at period-end"
    - "Entries posted by senior management or unusual users"
    - "Unusual or rarely used accounts"
    - "Entries with round amounts or duplicates"
    - "Entries reversing shortly after period-end"
    - "Entries affecting revenue or key estimates"
    - "Entries bypassing normal approval workflows"
  moderate_risk_criteria:
    - "Entries outside normal work hours"
    - "Entries to suspense or clearing accounts"
    - "Frequent adjustments to provisions or reserves"
  automated_selection_logic:
    - query: "Select JE where user IN (admin, director, CFO)"
    - query: "Select JE where account LIKE '999%'"
    - query: "Select JE with debit/credit > threshold"
    - query: "Select JE posted between last 3 days of the period"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. SELECTED JOURNALS — TESTING TABLE]

{{selected_journals_table}}

# Recommended human-readable table:

# | Ref | JE ID | Date | User | Description | Accounts Affected | Amount | Reason for Selection | Procedures Performed | Exceptions |

JETEST_SCHEMA:
  ref: "<string>"

  exceptions_found: "<text|null>"
  fraud_indicators:
    - "<override>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. EXCEPTIONS SUMMARY & FRAUD INDICATORS]

{{exceptions_summary}}

Template:
- List of exceptions with JE IDs
- Fraud indicators identified (ISA 240 red flags)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[10. CONCLUSION ON MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE RISK]

Conclusion:
{{conclusion}}

Should include:
