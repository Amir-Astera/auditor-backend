INCOME TAX AUDIT PROGRAM — IAS 12  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This program provides a structured approach to auditing income tax expense, 
current tax liabilities, deferred tax balances, and uncertain tax positions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. TAX RECONCILIATION SUMMARY]

{{tax_reconciliation}}

Reconcile:
- PBT (profit before tax)
- Adjustments (permanent differences)
- Taxable income
- Current tax expense  
- Deferred tax expense  
- Total tax charge  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. CURRENT TAX PROVISION TESTING]

{{current_tax}}

Procedures:
- Obtain tax return draft/working papers  
- Recalculate taxable profit  
- Agree adjustments to supporting documents  
- Verify permanent and temporary differences  
- Trace tax payments to cash/bank (E20 linkage)  
- Review prior-year adjustments  
- Evaluate penalties / interest  
- Agree final provision to GL  

Machine schema:

CURRENT_TAX_SCHEMA:
  id: "<TAXxx>"
  taxable_income: "<numeric>"
  tax_rate: "<numeric>"
  calculated_tax: "<numeric>"
  recorded_tax: "<numeric>"
  variance: "<numeric>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES TESTING]

{{temporary_differences}}

Temporary differences categories:
- Depreciation vs tax depreciation  
- Provisions not deductible until paid  
- Unrealised FX  
- Impairment allowances  
- Fair value adjustments  
- Lease liability vs ROU asset (IFRS 16)  
- Revenue recognition timing differences

  temporary_difference: "<numeric>"
  deferred_tax_rate: "<numeric>"
  dta_dtl_amount: "<numeric>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. TESTING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS & LIABILITIES (DTA / DTL)]

{{dta_dtl_testing}}

IAS 12 rules:
- DTA / DTL recorded for ALL temporary differences except initial recognition exemptions  
- DTA recognised only to the extent of probable future taxable profits  
- Goodwill exceptions  

Schema:

DTA_DTL_SCHEMA:
  id: "<DTxx>"
  temp_diff_id: "<TDxx>"
  dta_or_dtl: "<DTA|DTL>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  recognition_criteria_met: "<true|false>"
  reversal_expectation: "<text>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. DTA RECOVERABILITY TESTING]

{{recoverability_testing}}

Procedures:
- Review budgets/forecasts  
- Test reasonableness of assumptions  
- Test historical forecasting accuracy  
- Evaluate reversal of temporary differences  
- Evaluate tax-planning opportunities  
- Evaluate expiration of losses (carry-forward rules)  

Schema:

DTA_RECOVERABILITY_SCHEMA:
  id: "<RECxx>"

  forecast_period: "<years>"
  future_taxable_profit: "<numeric>"

  recoverable: "<true|false>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS (IFRIC 23)**]

{{utp_analysis}}

Uncertain positions require:
- Apply **most-likely amount** or **expected value**  
- Evaluate likelihood of challenge by tax authority  
- Review correspondence with tax authority  
- Review legal letters (ISA 501 linkage)  
- Evaluate interest and penalties  

Schema:

UTP_SCHEMA:
  id: "<UTPxx>"
  issue_description: "<text>"
  probable_outflow: "<numeric>"
  measurement_method: "<most_likely|expected_value>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  impact_on_current_tax: "<numeric>"
  impact_on_deferred_tax: "<numeric>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. TAX RATE RECONCILIATION TESTING**

{{tax_rate_reconciliation}}

Reconcile:
- Effective tax rate (ETR) vs statutory  
- Permanent differences  
- Non-deductible expenses  
- Tax incentives  
- Withholding taxation  
- Differences due to other jurisdictions  

Schema:

ETR_SCHEMA:

  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. EXCEPTIONS SUMMARY]

{{exceptions_summary}}

Exception schema:

EXCEPTION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<string>"
  area: "<current_tax|temporary_diff|dta|dtl|utp|tax_rate>"

  amount: "<numeric>"
  severity: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  linked_misstatement: "<MISID or null>"
  impact_on_FS: "<text>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. OVERALL CONCLUSION]

{{conclusion}}

Conclusion categories:
1. Current tax reasonable  
2. Temporary differences correct  
3. DTA/DTL recognised appropriately  
4. UTP appropriately measured  
5. Exceptions immaterial  
6. Material misstatement exists  
7. Insufficient evidence → scope limitation  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[10. APPENDICES]

{{appendices}}

Typical:
- Tax calculation workbook  
- Temporary differences schedule  
- Prior-year tax returns  
- Correspondence with authorities
