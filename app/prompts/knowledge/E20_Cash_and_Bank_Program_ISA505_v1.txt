CASH & BANK AUDIT PROGRAM — ISA 505  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This program provides a complete ISA 505-based approach to external confirmations,
testing reconciliations, evaluating restrictions, and performing cut-off procedures.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. BANK ACCOUNTS OVERVIEW]

{{bank_accounts}}

Typical categories:
- Operating accounts  
- FX accounts  
- Deposit accounts  
- Escrow accounts  
- Restricted/pledged balances  
- Credit facilities  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT (ISA 315 + ISA 240)]

{{risk_assessment}}

Key risks:
- existence risk (overstatement)  
- fraud risk (ISA 240 → manipulation of cash, fictitious balances)  
- restriction classification issues  
- unrecorded loans or overdrafts  
- foreign currency misstatement  

Mandatory fraud considerations:
- unusual transfers near period-end  
- manual JEs to bank accounts (link to E11)  
- unusual bank accounts not disclosed by management  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. MACHINE-READABLE CONFIRMATION SCHEMA]

BANK_CONFIRMATION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<CONFxx>"
  bank_name: "<string>"
  account_number: "<string>"
  currency: "<string>"
  confirmed_balance: "<numeric>"
  client_balance: "<numeric>"
  difference: "<numeric>"
  credit_facilities: "<details>"
  guarantees: "<details>"
  restrictions: "<details>"
  confirmation_received: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. CONFIRMATIONS PLAN (ISA 505 MANDATORY FOR CASH)]

{{confirmations_plan}}

ISA 505 requires:
- direct communication with the bank  
- auditor controls the request and response  
- positive confirmation (always for cash)

Plan must include:
- all bank accounts, including sleeping accounts  
- loan facilities  
- guarantees  
- pledged deposits  
- escrow accounts  

Indicators of fraud:
- management refusal to allow confirmations  
- delays or unusual responses  
- requests to use non-standard format  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. BANK RECONCILIATION TESTING]

{{bank_reconciliations}}

Steps:
- Obtain year-end bank reconciliations  
- Agree bank balance per reconciliation to confirmation  
- Test outstanding deposits:
  * trace to subsequent bank statement  
- Test outstanding cheques/payments:
  * trace to subsequent clearing  
- Investigate long-outstanding items  
- Recalculate the reconciliation  

Machine schema:

BANK_REC_SCHEMA:
  id: "<RECxx>"
  account_number: "<string>"
  book_balance: "<numeric>"
  confirmed_balance: "<numeric>"
  outstanding_deposits: "<numeric>"
  outstanding_payments: "<numeric>"
  reconciling_items_valid: "<true|false>"
  difference_unexplained: "<numeric>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. CUT-OFF TESTING]

{{cutoff_testing}}

Cut-off testing includes:
- tracing pre- and post-period-end cash receipts to AR  
- tracing pre- and post-period-end cash disbursements to AP  
- inspecting large transfers between accounts (ISA 240 fraud indicator)  
- verifying unusual late postings  

Machine schema:

CASH_CUTOFF_SCHEMA:
  id: "<COxx>"
  transaction_type: "<receipt|payment|transfer>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  bank_date: "<date>"
  posting_date: "<date>"
  correct_period: "<true|false>"
  counter-account: "<AR|AP|Loan|Other>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. RESTRICTED / PLEDGED CASH (CLASSIFICATION TESTING)]

{{restricted_cash}}

Restricted cash must be:
- separately disclosed  
- not included in cash equivalents if restricted  
- tested for restrictions / pledges  
- confirmed with banks

Testing:
- review loan agreements  
- review guarantee letters  
- inspect pledge agreements  
- ensure proper classification  

Schema:

RESTRICTED_CASH_SCHEMA:
  id: "<RCxx>"
  account_number: "<string>"
  restriction_type: "<pledge|escrow|legal_hold>"
  restriction_source: "<contract|court|bank>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  disclosure_adequate: "<true|false>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES (IF CONFIRMATION NOT RECEIVED)]

{{alt_procedures}}

Acceptable alternatives:
- inspect subsequent bank statements  
- inspect original bank documents  
- inspect online banking screenshots **only if verified independently**  
- review agreements and statements directly obtained  

Not acceptable (ISA 505):
- management-prepared screenshots without independent evidence  
- verbal confirmations  
- spreadsheets with balances  

Evidence hierarchy:
external > auditor-obtained > internal > management representations  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[11. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER AREAS]

Links:
- E11 Journal Entries Testing

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[12. OVERALL CONCLUSION]

{{conclusion}}

Conclusion categories:
1. Cash balances exist and are free from restriction  
2. Balances agree to bank confirmations  
3. Reconciling items valid and supported  
4. Restrictions appropriately disclosed  
5. Misstatements identified (quantify)  

If confirmations not received → evaluate scope limitation.
