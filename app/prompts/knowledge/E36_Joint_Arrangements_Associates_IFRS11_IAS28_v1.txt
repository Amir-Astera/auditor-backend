Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This audit program evaluates classification, measurement, impairment,
and disclosures relating to associates, joint operations, and joint ventures.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. STRUCTURE OF JOINT ARRANGEMENTS & ASSOCIATES]

{{ja_structure}}

Include:
- Associates (significant influence)  
- Joint ventures (equity method)  
- Joint operations (direct recognition)  
- Contractual arrangements  
- Ownership structure  
- Voting rights and rights to returns  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT — IAS 28 + IFRS 11]

{{risk_assessment}}

Key risks:
- Incorrect classification (associate vs JV vs JO)  
- Incorrect equity method adjustments  
- Missing elimination of unrealized profit  
- Incorrect calculation of group share  
- Missing impairment indicators (IAS 36)  
- Inconsistent accounting policies  
- Missing IFRS 12 disclosures  

Fraud risks:
- Shifting profits via upstream/downstream transactions  
- Hiding losses in equity-accounted entities  
- Manipulating “significant influence” to avoid consolidation
