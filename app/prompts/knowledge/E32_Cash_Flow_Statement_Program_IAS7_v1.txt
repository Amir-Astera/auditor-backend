CASH FLOW STATEMENT — IAS 7  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This program evaluates classification, completeness, non-cash adjustments,
and mathematical correctness of the cash flow statement.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. METHOD USED — DIRECT OR INDIRECT]

{{cfs_method}}

If **Indirect method** — most common:  
- Begin with profit before tax  
- Adjust for non-cash items  
- Adjust for working capital movements  
- Remove investing/financing items  

If **Direct method**:  
- Cash receipts  
- Cash payments  
- Reconcile to bank  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. RISK ASSESSMENT — IAS 7]

{{risk_assessment}}

Key risks:
- Misclassification between operating / investing / financing  
- Missing non-cash adjustments  
- Incorrect working capital movements  
- Mathematical errors  
- Cash flow that contradicts balance sheet movements  
- Manipulation to improve operating cash flow  
- Missing significant non-cash transactions (leases, PPE, provisions)  

Fraud risks:
- Artificially inflating CFO (operating cash flow)  
- Reclassifying interest paid/received  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. MACHINE-READY CASH FLOW SCHEMA]

CASHFLOW_SCHEMA:
  id: "<CFxx>"
  section: "<operating|investing|financing>"
  description: "<text>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  classification_ok: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. OPERATING ACTIVITIES TESTING — INDIRECT METHOD]

{{operating_activities}}

Operating section must include:
- Profit before tax  
- Non-cash adjustments:  
  * depreciation, amortization  
  * impairment gains/losses  
  * gains/losses on disposals  
  * unrealized FX  
  * ECL adjustments  
  * fair value adjustments  
  * provisions (E27 linkage)  
  * leases (interest + depreciation components)  
- Working capital movements:  
  * AR  
  * inventory  
  * AP  
  * cash advances  
  * contract assets and liabilities (IFRS 15 linkage)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. NON-CASH MOVEMENTS REQUIRED BY IAS 7.43–44A]

{{non_cash_movements}}

Companies must disclose changes in liabilities from financing activities, including:
- New leases recognized under IFRS 16  
- FX revaluation  
- Fair value changes

{{working_capital_adjustments}}

Movements must reconcile to:
- AR schedule  
- Inventory schedule (E17, E25)  
- AP schedule  
- Contract balances (IFRS 15)  
- Tax balances (IAS 12)

Test:
- Accuracy  
- Direction of movement  
- Consistency with FS

  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. RECONCILIATION TO BANK STATEMENTS (E20 LINK)**]

{{reconciliation_to_bank}}

Tests:
- CFS ending cash must match SoFP cash  
- Bank confirmations must agree (ISA 505)  
- Test bank transfers at YE  
- Analytical review of cash patterns  

Schema:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[11. OVERALL CONCLUSION]

{{conclusion}}

Possible outcomes:
1. CFS mathematically accurate  
2. Classification compliant with IAS 7  
3. Non-cash movements complete  
4. Linkage with FS consistent  
5. Exceptions immaterial  
6. Material misstatement exists  
7. Insufficient evidence → scope limitation  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

{{appendices}}

Typical items:
- Detailed CFS workbook  
- Non-cash movement schedule  
- Working capital reconciliation
