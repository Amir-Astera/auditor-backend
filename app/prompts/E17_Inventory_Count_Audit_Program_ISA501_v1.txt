━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. INVENTORY RISK ASSESSMENT (ISA 315)]

{{risk_assessment}}

Typical risk factors:
- Susceptibility to theft or manipulation  
- High volume of transactions  
- Manual inventory processes  
- Complex SKU structure  
- High estimation uncertainty in NRV  
- Slow-moving or obsolete items  
- Weak IT controls (if inventory managed through ERP)  

Mandatory link to SRM (E10):
- Inventory existence risk → High  
- Inventory valuation (NRV) → High

[2. MACHINE-READABLE SCHEMA]

INVENTORY_COUNT_SCHEMA:
  id: "<ICxx>"
  sku: "<string>"
  description: "<text>"
  category: "<raw material|WIP|finished goods>"
  auditor_count: "<qty>"
  client_count: "<qty>"
  variance: "<qty>"
  variance_value: "<numeric>"
  reason_for_variance: "<text>"
  evidence_reference: "<WP ref>"
  follow_up_required: "<true|false>"
  valuation_test_ref: "<VALxx>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. PRE-COUNT PROCEDURES (MANDATORY)]

{{pre_count_procedures}}

Checklist:
- Obtain and review inventory count instructions from management  
- Evaluate count procedures for adequacy:  
  * segregation of duties  
  * count team independence  
  * use of pre-numbered tags or scanners  
- Walkthrough of the physical process (if possible)  
- Identify high-risk items for targeted procedures  
- Determine sampling approach  
- Ensure completeness of inventory listing  
- Evaluate risks of manipulation before count (ISA 240 link)  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. DURING-COUNT PROCEDURES]

{{during_count_procedures}}

Mandatory ISA 501 requirements:

1. **Observe counting procedures**  
   - Ensure compliance with management’s instructions  
   - Confirm no movement of goods during count  
   - Observe scanning/tagging activity  
   - Assess controls over count sheets  

2. **Perform test counts (two-directional testing)**  
   - *Sheet-to-floor:* verify listed items exist  
   - *Floor-to-sheet:* verify all items counted are listed  

3. **Evaluate count variances**  
   - Investigate variances  
   - Review recounts  
   - Evaluate validity of adjustments  

4. **High-risk targeted testing**  
   - High-value SKUs  
   - Easily concealable items  
   - Slow-moving or obsolete stock  
   - Negative quantity items  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. POST-COUNT PROCEDURES]

{{post_count_procedures}}

Required steps:

- Obtain final count sheets and reconcile to auditor’s observations  
- Review management adjustments to inventory  
- Test *roll-forward* from count date to YE  
- If count after YE → *roll-back* procedures  
- Test cut-off for purchases and sales  
- Analyze unusual journal entries affecting inventory (link to E11)  
- Test inventory reconciliation between subledger and GL  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. VALUATION TESTING (IAS 2 COMPLIANCE)]

{{valuation_testing}}

Inventory must be valued at:
- **Lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV)**  

NRV testing includes:
- Aging analysis  
- Subsequent selling prices  
- Cost-to-complete  
- Write-down policies  
- NRV adjustments  

Machine schema:

VALUATION_TEST_SCHEMA:
  id: "<VALxx>"
  est_id: "<ESTxx if valuation considered an estimate>"
  sku: "<string>"
  cost: "<numeric>"
  nrv: "<numeric>"
  lower_of_cost_or_nrv: "<numeric>"
  write_down_required: "<true|false>"
  write_down_amount: "<numeric>"
  supporting_evidence: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. INVENTORY ANALYTICS]

Mandatory analytics:
- Gross margin analysis  
- Inventory turnover  
- Days inventory outstanding (DIO)  
- Identification of unusual or negative-margin SKUs  
- Comparison to prior year counts  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. DETAILED INVENTORY TESTING TABLE]

Recommended table:

{{inventory_testing_table}}

# | SKU | Description | Client Qty | Auditor Qty | Variance | Value Impact | NRV Adjustment | Evidence | Exception? |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. EXCEPTIONS SUMMARY]

{{exceptions_summary}}

Exception schema:

EXCEPTION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<string>"
  sku: "<string>"
  variance: "<qty>"
  variance_value: "<numeric>"
  nature_of_issue: "<count_error|theft_indicator|listing_incomplete|valuation_issue>"
  severity: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  linked_misstatement: "<MISID or null>"
  impact_on_FS: "<text>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[10. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER AREAS]

Links to:
- SRM (E10): existence + valuation risks  
- Estimates (E16): NRV is an estimate  
- JE Testing (E11): inventory adjustments  
- SUD (E8): unadjusted variances and NRV issues  
- ACM (E7): inventory section  
- SE (E12): events impacting NRV post-YE  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[11. OVERALL CONCLUSION]

{{conclusion}}

Conclusion categories:
1. Inventory quantities fairly stated  
2. Inventory valuation reasonable and compliant with IAS 2  
3. Misstatements identified but not material  
4. Material misstatement → Qualified / Adverse  
5. Insufficient evidence → Scope limitation → Disclaimer
