AUDIT EVIDENCE SUMMARY — ISA 500  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This document summarises evidence obtained across the audit and evaluates whether it is
sufficient and appropriate to support the audit opinion.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK — ISA 500 REQUIREMENTS]

Per ISA 500, audit evidence must be:

- **Sufficient** (quantity)  
- **Appropriate** (quality: relevance + reliability)

Reliability hierarchy (Big4 standard):
1. Evidence obtained directly by auditor >  
2. Evidence from external sources >  
3. Evidence from internal sources >  
4. Evidence based on management representations  

Types of evidence:
- Inspection  
- Observation  
- Inquiry  
- Confirmation  
- Recalculation  
- Reperformance  
- Analytical procedures

[2. MACHINE-READABLE EVIDENCE SCHEMA]

EVIDENCE_SCHEMA:
  id: "<EVxx>"
  area: "<Financial Statement area>"
  risk_id: "<SRxx or null>"
  procedure_id: "<PROCxx>"
  type: "<inspection|observation|inquiry|confirmation|recalculation|reperformance|analytics>"
  source: "<external|internal|auditor-generated>"
  reliability: "<High|Medium|Low>"
  evidence_description: "<text>"

  linkage_to_opinion: "<text>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. EVIDENCE MATRIX (AREA-BY-AREA SUMMARY)]

{{evidence_matrix}}

Recommended format:

# | Area | Risk ID | Procedures Performed | Type of Evidence | Reliability | Exceptions | Conclusion |

Example:
# | Revenue | SR01 | ToD, analytics, JE test | External invoices / system data | High | None | Supported |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. RISK LINKAGE SUMMARY (ISA 315 + ISA 330)]

Every **significant risk** must have:
- documented response  
- documented evidence  
- conclusion supporting or contradicting management’s assertions  

{{risk_linkage_summary}}

Template:

RISK_LINKAGE_SCHEMA:
  risk_id: "<SRxx>"
  assertion: "<occurrence / valuation / completeness / cutoff>"
  planned_response: "<text>"
  evidence_ids: ["<EV01>", "<EV02>", "..."]
  exceptions_found: "<summary>"
  residual_risk_assessment: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  conclusion: "<supported|not_supported>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. TESTING SUMMARY (FROM G2.9/G2.10/J17)]

Summarise procedures:
- Tests of controls  
- Substantive analytical procedures  
- Tests of details  

{{testing_summary}}

Suggested format:

# | Area | ToC Result | SAP Result | ToD Result | Evidence Strength | Final Assessment |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. EXCEPTIONS SUMMARY & IMPACT ON MISSTATEMENTS]

Combine:
- JE exceptions (E11)  
- Related party exceptions (E14)  
- Subsequent events exceptions (E12)  
- Estimate issues (E16 forthcoming)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. EVALUATION OF SUFFICIENCY & APPROPRIATENESS (ISA 500 REQUIRED)]

{{overall_evidence_assessment}}

Checklist for the auditor:

SUFFICIENCY:
- Have all planned procedures been performed?  
- Has sampling coverage been met?  
- Are high-risk assertions supported by sufficient evidence?  

APPROPRIATENESS:
- Is evidence reliable?  
- Is external evidence used where possible?  
- Are management representations used only when appropriate?  

GAPS TO IDENTIFY:
- Missing confirmations  
- Insufficient evidence for estimates  
- Weak or contradictory audit evidence  
- Reliance on management representations only  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. OVERALL CONCLUSION (FOR PARTNER REVIEW)]

{{conclusion}}

Conclusion categories:

1. **Evidence is sufficient and appropriate**  
   → Audit opinion can be formed without modification.  

2. **Evidence is sufficient but inconsistent**  
   → Additional procedures required.  

3. **Evidence insufficient due to management limitations**  
   → Scope limitation → possible Disclaimer.  

4. **Evidence indicates misstatement not corrected**  
   → Impact on SUD → possible Qualified or Adverse opinion.  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. APPENDICES]

{{appendices}}

Suggested appendices:
- Full evidence index  
- Confirmation responses summary  
- List of procedures not performed and justification  
- Summary of representations received (ISA 580)  
- Extracts of recalculation/reperformance work
