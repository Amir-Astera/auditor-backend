ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AUDIT PROGRAM — ISA 540 (REVISED)
Client: {{client_name}}
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

This document provides a structured program to audit accounting estimates, 
considering estimation uncertainty, complexity, model risk, management bias,
and the quality of evidence, in accordance with ISA 540 (Revised).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. OVERVIEW OF ESTIMATES (IFRS-BASED)]

List of key estimates identified:
{{estimate_catalog}}

Examples:
- Expected Credit Loss (IFRS 9)
- Fair value of investment property / FV instruments (IFRS 13)
- Provisions & contingencies (IAS 37)
- Impairment testing (IAS 36)
- Warranty reserves
- Actuarial liabilities (IAS 19)
- Inventory NRV assessments (IAS 2)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. MACHINE-READABLE ESTIMATE SCHEMA]

    - "<complexity>"
    - "<subjectivity>"
    - "<management bias indicators>"
    - "<data quality issues>"
  management_approach:
    model_description: "<text>"

    assumption_testing_ref: "<WP reference>"
    data_testing_ref: "<WP reference>"
  exceptions: "<summary>"
  conclusion: "<supported|not_supported>"
  impact_on_FS: "<amount or text>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. RISK ASSESSMENT (ISA 315 + ISA 540 REQUIREMENTS)]

{{risk_assessment}}

Risk factors to consider:
- High estimation uncertainty  
- Use of complex models  
- Significant management judgment  
- Susceptibility to bias  
- Changes in method, assumptions, or inputs year-over-year  
- Indicators from fraud risk assessment  

Mandatory fraud considerations (ISA 240):
- Bias indicators  
- Overly optimistic assumptions  
- Selective use of inputs  
- Inconsistent rationale  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. ESTIMATE TESTING TABLE]

{{estimates_table}}

Recommended format:

# | Est. ID | Name | Risk Level | Model? | Assumptions | Data Sources | Uncertainty | Procedures | Conclusion |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. THREE-PART TESTING STRUCTURE (ISA 540 MANDATORY)]

Auditor must evaluate:

1. **The Model** (if applicable)  
2. **The Assumptions**  
3. **The Data**  

Including whether each element is:
- relevant  
- complete  
- accurate  
- consistent  
- unbiased  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. MODEL TESTING]

{{model_testing}}

MODEL_TESTING_SCHEMA:
  est_id: "<ESTxx>"
  model_type: "<statistical|actuarial|valuation|scenario model|none>"
  model_complexity: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  model_owner: "<management|external expert>"
  controls_tested: "<yes/no>"
  recalculation_performed: "<yes/no>"
  independent_model_challenge: "<yes/no>"
  assumptions_supported_by_model: "<list>"
  weaknesses_identified: "<text>"

Questions to document:
- Is the model consistent with IFRS?  
- Does it reflect market participant assumptions (IFRS 13)?  
- Is the model mathematically correct?  
- Does management understand the model?  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. ASSUMPTION TESTING]

{{assumption_testing}}

ASSUMPTION_SCHEMA:
  est_id: "<ESTxx>"
  assumption: "<text>"
  type: "<key assumption|secondary>"
  sensitivity: "<quantitative impact>"
  benchmarked_against: "<external data|historical data|industry data>"
  reasonableness_assessment: "<supported|not_supported>"
  fraud_bias_indicator: "<true|false>"
  evidence_reference: "<WP ref>"

Common assumptions:
- Discount rates  
- Default rates (ECL)  
- Recovery rates  
- Growth rates  
- Fair value inputs (yield, cap rate, volatility)  
- Litigation probability/outflow  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. DATA TESTING]

{{data_testing}}

DATA_TESTING_SCHEMA:
  est_id: "<ESTxx>"
  data_source: "<internal|external>"
  data_quality: "<High|Medium|Low>"
  completeness_tested: "<yes/no>"
  accuracy_tested: "<yes/no>"
  outlier_review: "<yes/no>"
  exceptions_found: "<text>"
  evidence_reference: "<WP ref>"

Examples of data:
- Aged receivables (ECL)  
- Appraisals / market data (IFRS 13)  
- Historical actuals vs forecast  
- Legal claims data (IAS 37)  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. MANAGEMENT BIAS EVALUATION (ISA 540 + ISA 240)]

{{management_bias}}

Bias indicators:
- Consistently optimistic assumptions  
- Selective use of data  
- Omitting contradictory evidence  
- Change in assumptions without basis  
- Intentionally narrow scenario ranges  
- Inconsistent explanations year-over-year  

Bias Schema:

BIAS_SCHEMA:
  est_id: "<ESTxx>"
  indicator: "<text>"
  evidence: "<WP ref>"
  severity: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  conclusion: "<bias_present|no_bias>"

[10. EXCEPTIONS SUMMARY]

{{exceptions}}

Exception schema:

EXCEPTION_SCHEMA:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[11. OVERALL CONCLUSION ON ESTIMATES]

{{conclusion}}

Categories:
1. **Estimates supported and reasonable**  
2. **Estimates reasonable but require enhanced disclosure**  
3. **Estimates materially misstated** → SUD impact → Opinion modification  
4. **Insufficient evidence** → Scope limitation → Possible Disclaimer

Suggested appendices:
- Sensitivity analysis worksheets  
- ECL calculation models  
- FV model extracts  
- Historical accuracy study
