SEGMENT REPORTING — IFRS 8  
Client: {{client_name}}  
Period Ended: {{period_end}}

IFRS 8 requires reporting based on internal management information used by the CODM.
Accuracy and consistency with internal reporting is critical.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1. SEGMENT STRUCTURE]

{{segment_structure}}

Typical segmentation:
- Business lines (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, financial services)  
- Geographical regions  
- Product groups  
- Customer classes  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[2. IDENTIFICATION OF CODM (KEY IFRS 8 REQUIREMENT)**]

{{codm_identification}}

Tests:
- Identify the individual or group making key resource allocation decisions  
- Review Board minutes  
- Evaluate management reporting packages sent to CODM  
- Verify frequency of review  

Schema:

CODM_SCHEMA:
  id: "<CODMxx>"
  role: "<CEO|COO|Board|Management Committee>"
  reports_received: "<text>"
  frequency: "<monthly|quarterly>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[3. RISK ASSESSMENT — IFRS 8]

{{risk_assessment}}

Key risks:
- Incorrect identification of segments  
- Manipulation of internal reporting to hide losses  
- Incorrect aggregation  
- Inconsistent KPI definitions  
- Incorrect reconciliation to FS  
- Missing entity-wide disclosures  
- Missing significant customers disclosure  

Fraud risks:
- Reassigning divisions to manipulate profitability presentation  
- Moving costs between segments  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[4. MACHINE-READY SEGMENT SCHEMA]

SEGMENT_SCHEMA:
  id: "<SEGxx>"
  segment_name: "<text>"
  revenue: "<numeric>"
  profit_measure: "<numeric>"
  assets_reported: "<numeric>"
  liabilities_reported: "<numeric>"
  kpi_values: "<list>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[5. IDENTIFICATION OF OPERATING SEGMENTS**

{{operating_segments}}

Tests:
- Identify components reviewed by CODM  
- Determine which segments engage in business activities  
- Determine segments for which discrete financial information exists  
- Identify reportable segments (>10% tests)  

Schema:

OPERATING_SEGMENT_SCHEMA:
  id: "<OPSEGxx>"
  segment_name: "<string>"
  business_activity: "<text>"
  discrete_info: "<true|false>"
  codm_reviewed: "<true|false>"
  reportable: "<true|false>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[6. AGGREGATION TESTING (IFRS 8.12–14)**]

{{aggregation_testing}}

Aggregation allowed only if:
- segments have similar economic characteristics  
- similar nature of products/services  
- similar production processes  
- similar customers  
- similar distribution  

Schema:

AGGREGATION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<AGGxx>"
  segments_aggregated: "<list>"
  basis_for_aggregation: "<text>"
  justification_ok: "<true|false>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[7. SEGMENT MEASURES (REVENUE, PROFIT, ASSETS)**]

{{segment_measures}}

Auditor must test:
- definitions of segment profit/loss  
- consistency with internal reporting  
- adjustments from IFRS measures  
- inclusion/exclusion of items  

Schema:

SEGMENT_MEASURES_SCHEMA:
  id: "<MEASxx>"
  segment_id: "<SEGxx>"
  measure_type: "<profit|revenue|assets|liabilities>"
  amount: "<numeric>"
  basis: "<text>"
  reconciles_to_IFRS: "<true|false>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[8. KPI TESTING (MEASURES PROVIDED TO CODM)**]

{{kpi_testing}}

Examples:
- EBITDA  
- ROIC  
- Contribution margin  
- Customer churn  
- Backlog  

Schema:

KPI_SCHEMA:
  id: "<KPIxx>"
  segment_id: "<SEGxx>"
  kpi_name: "<string>"
  kpi_value: "<numeric>"
  calculation_basis: "<text>"
  consistent_with_internal_reports: "<true|false>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[9. RECONCILIATIONS TO FS (IFRS 8.28)**]

{{reconciliations}}

Auditor must test:
- Revenue reconciliation (segment → total revenue)  
- Profit/loss reconciliation  
- Total assets reconciliation  
- Total liabilities reconciliation  

Schema:

RECON_SCHEMA:
  id: "<RECONxx>"
  type: "<revenue|profit|assets|liabilities>"
  total_per_segments: "<numeric>"
  total_per_FS: "<numeric>"
  reconciling_items: "<text>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[10. ENTITY-WIDE DISCLOSURES (IFRS 8.31–34)**]

{{entity_wide_disclosures}}

Must test:
- Revenues by products/services  
- Revenues by geography  
- Non-current assets by geography  
- Information about major customers  

Schema:

ENTITY_WIDE_SCHEMA:
  id: "<EWxx>"
  disclosure_type: "<products|geography|non_current_assets>"
  details: "<text>"
  evidence_ref: "<WP ref>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[11. MAJOR CUSTOMERS DISCLOSURE (IF ≥ 10% REVENUE)**]

{{major_customers}}

Tests:
- Identify all customers >10% of total revenue  
- Confirm segment to which revenue belongs  
- Confirm disclosure provided (name NOT required)  

Schema:

CUSTOMER_SCHEMA:
  id: "<CUSxx>"
  customer_revenue: "<numeric>"
  percentage_of_total: "<numeric>"
  segment_name: "<string>"
  disclosure_required: "<true|false>"
  disclosed: "<true|false>"
  exception_flag: "<true|false>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[12. EXCEPTIONS SUMMARY]

{{exceptions_summary}}

Exception schema:

EXCEPTION_SCHEMA:
  id: "<string>"
  segment_id: "<SEGxx>"
  area: "<identification|aggregation|measure|KPI|reconciliation|entitywide>"
  description: "<text>"
  severity: "<Low|Medium|High>"
  impact_on_FS: "<text>"
  linked_misstatement: "<MISID or null>"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[13. OVERALL CONCLUSION]

{{conclusion}}

Possible conclusions:
1. IFRS 8 disclosures complete and accurate  
2. Segments identified correctly  
3. Measures consistent with CODM reporting  
4. Reconciliations accurate  
5. Exceptions immaterial  
6. Material misstatement exists  
7. Insufficient evidence → scope limitation  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Internal management reports  
- CODM packages  
- Segment schedules  
- KPI calculation files
