LANG: EN
TYPE: ROUTING_PROMPTS
STANDARDS: ISA700, ISA705, ISA706
VERSION: 1.0

# PURPOSE
#   Use final information (misstatements, going concern, scope limitations)
#   to determine the appropriate type of opinion and route to J19.OPINION / J20.REPORT.

# INPUT_FIELDS
#   misstatements_total
#   misstatements_unadjusted
#   performance_materiality
#   pervasive_effect           # true/false (judgemental)
#   going_concern_issue        # none / disclosed / not_disclosed
#   scope_limitation           # none / material_not_pervasive / material_pervasive

# QUESTIONS
Q1: Are there material misstatements that remain unadjusted?
Q2: Are the misstatements pervasive to the financial statements?
Q3: Is there any material uncertainty related to going concern?
Q4: Has management appropriately disclosed the going concern uncertainty?
Q5: Were there any significant scope limitations that prevented necessary procedures?

# BASIC LOGIC (high level – detailed tree in D3 file)
- If no material misstatements AND no scope limitations AND no going concern issue:
    opinion_type = "Unmodified"
- Else evaluate:
    * misstatements vs PM and pervasiveness
    * scope limitation
    * going concern disclosure
  and map to: Qualified / Adverse / Disclaimer of opinion.

# OUTPUT STRUCTURE
{
  "opinion_type": "Unmodified|Qualified|Adverse|Disclaimer",
  "basis_for_opinion_required": true,
  "emphasis_of_matter": "<optional>",
  "other_matter": "<optional>",
  "next_block": "J20_REPORT"
}
